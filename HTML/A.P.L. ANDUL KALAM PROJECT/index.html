        <p>Aftre Govt.approval, kalam expanded the programme to include more engineers. In 1970s, he had made an effort
            to develop the polar setellite LanchVehicle (PSLV) with an aim to follow india to lanch its Indian remote
            Sensing (IRS) satellite into Sun-Synchronous orbit, PSLV project was successfully and on 20 September 1993,

        <p> <b>xWhat is Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle </b></p>
        <p>Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV) is a small-capacity satellite launch vehicle developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The ASLV was designed to launch small payloads into low Earth orbit, and was used for five launches between 1987 and 1994. The ASLV was retired in 1994, after being superseded by more powerful launch vehicles such as the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and the Geostationary Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV).

            The ASLV was a four-stage rocket, with the first three stages powered by solid rocket motors and the fourth stage powered by a liquid-fueled rocket engine. The ASLV had a payload capacity of about 150 kilograms, and was capable of placing its payload into a circular orbit at an altitude of around 600 kilometers. The ASLV was primarily used to launch small scientific and experimental satellites for the Indian government and other countries.</p>

        <p> <b>What was PSLV’s most recent mission? </b></p>
        <p>The rocket launched on Saturday carried TeLEOS-2 as the primary satellite and Lumelite-4 as a co-passenger
            satellite, ISRO said in a statement.
            While TeLEOS-2 will “be used to support the satellite imagery requirements of various agencies within the
            Government of Singapore”, Lumelite-4 “aims to augment Singapore’s e-navigation maritime safety and benefit
            the global shipping community”, the space agency said.
            POEM-2, meanwhile, will “be utilised as an orbital platform to carry out scientific experiments through
            non-separating payloads. The payloads belong to ISRO/Department of Space, Bellatrix, Dhruva Space, and
            Indian Institute of Astrophysics,” ISRO said.
        </p>
        <p> <b>What is PSLV?</b></p>
        <p>PSLV is the most reliable rocket used by ISRO to date. Its first launch was in 1994, and it has been ISRO’s
            main rocket ever since.
            Apart from Indian satellites, it also carries satellites from other nations into space, like in the current
            mission, where it carried payloads from Singapore. The reason for this is that apart from being reliable,
            the PSLV is also more affordable than the launch vehicles of many other countries.
            Besides, the vehicle successfully launched two spacecraft, Chandrayaan-1 in 2008 and Mars Orbiter Spacecraft
            in 2013, that later travelled to Moon and Mars respectively.</p>
